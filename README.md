# genderDisparityD3

Chris Sexton, James Byrne, and Yeonjoo Jung.

### Overview

Interactive Charts presenting global-scale gender disparity measurements using __d3.js__

Data is collected from the [World Bank Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx), specifically data based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The site can be cloned and served from a local web server, I use python:

```python -m http.server```

Alternatively the site is also hosted on my github jekyll site [Sexton Analytics](https://sextoncj.github.io)
